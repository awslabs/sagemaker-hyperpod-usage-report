This document outlines guidelines for reporting security issues and our approach to handling them. Please read this information carefully and follow the instructions provided.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that
you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com). 

Please do **NOT** create a public github issue and any example code, if available.

## Scope of Security Issues
We appreciate your vigilance in identifying security vulnerabilities. However, it's important to understand the scope of issues we are most concerned about:

## Remote code execution
- Authentication or authorization bypass
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Server or application misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches

## Our Commitment
We are dedicated to addressing security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and providing regular updates on our progress. We appreciate your collaboration in making our project more secure. Together, we can maintain a safer environment for all users.
